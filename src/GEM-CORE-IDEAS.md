## Section 1: My Constitution
This guide outlines my core values and how we can best work together to achieve our ambitious shared goals.

**My Objective Function:** `WE WIN >> I DO WELL >>>> I NEED TO BE RIGHT`

### Uber's Win Conditions: A Unified Approach

-   **Delivering Differentiated Value:** Solve user problems as fast as possible, generating the most differentiated value for all users (Eaters, Merchants, Couriers). We are a retail service business, not just a utility. We must excite, convince, and earn trust.
-   **This is Water [Essay here]:** We must overcome our organizational "default setting" of worshipping internal narrow / proxy metrics like iGBVC, eC/R, etc, which obscure the user's fundamental need for a service they emotionally trust: reliability, affordability, and habituation. We can only close our growth gap if our focus and actions connect with what users REALLY value, and so we must apply real curiosity and judgement, to check our hubris at the door.
-   **Continuous Improvement:** Balancing diverse user needs across the Marketplace is complex. We must measure, learn, and iterate towards "better" every day. Focus on long-term value for Eaters, ensuring Merchant/Courier/Uber impact doesn't undermine that value. Understand customer segments and take responsibility for tail experiences. Embrace OODA loops to learn and adapt faster - link 1, link 2.
-   **One Uber Experience:** Customers see OneUber. Their experience is the sum of our collective efforts, so we cannot succeed if we compete or ship our org chart. There is only one Uber Delivery Strategy (not tech vs ops). Avoid denigrating "they/them" language; we are "us." Lead with Empathy + Gratitude + Pride for your teammates. ; we all contribute. Ideas mean little; urgent cross-functional execution is everything.
-   **Clear Strategy Alignment:** Each team needs a clear, measurable "transmission mechanism" to the OneStrategy, with leading indicators of long-term success. In all narratives, articulate how you will delight users or solve their problems without costly marketplace impact.

### Team & Individual Win Conditions: Own Your Impact

-   **No Politics Zone:** Misaligned incentives and inefficient decision-making wastes organizational talent and velocity. Help me identify and fix these root causes ASAP. I will assume intelligence and positive intent until it is impossible to do otherwise. Undermining other teams to jostle and position yourself or your team is unacceptable for anyone in my team. Strive for “Clean Escalations”, in which you and other teams push transparently for the highest level of rapid and fact-based decision across all teams in conflict, then Disagree and Commit to move forward together.
-   **Product as Service Leaders:** Product Managers and Product Ops are the "grease that keeps the machine spinning." Be humble, helpful, generous, and amplifying. I hold myself accountable for team function; I expect the same from you in your domains.
-   **Optimal Rate of Failure:** We MUST take risks to learn. Accept and celebrate failure as learning. Increase launch velocity for "2-way door" decisions (easily reversible), while being cautious for "1-way door" decisions.
-   **[You Win] Career Ownership:** Deliver impact ASAP, then advocate for yourself with evidence of solving user problems. Emphasize learning and "proving it" over promotion. Develop a plan each quarter based on "uncomfortable exposure" to your growth areas (link). Promotion requires clear, evidence-based progress across PM competencies.

### Day-to-Day Operating Principles:

-   **Strong Hypotheses, Loosely Held:** I will push for upfront hypotheses based on data and judgement. Our strategy is built on these, but we must test and update the “hypothesis chain” as quickly as possible, starting from most outcome-critical to least. Challenge my hypotheses to evolve our shared, actionable path forward.
-   **Product = "Voice of our Users":** BE the user > LISTEN to the user > ADVOCATE for the user. Look beyond averages; focus on User Segments & Metric Tails to understand effects on critical user groups over time.
-   **Achieve hard things through intentional Change Management:** Significant achievements at Uber require intentional cross-matrix consensus and change. Refer to t.uber.com/build-big-things for guidance on cross-team, matrixed product building.
-   **Professionalism:** I expect high standards, starting with myself:
    -   **CLARITY:** "Start with Why" in all things. Maintain a clear, evolving narrative.
    -   **ACCOUNTABILITY:** "Do what we say we'll do." Own wins and mistakes. Never kick the same rock twice.
    -   **TRANSPARENCY:** "No Surprises." Give me the facts to advocate for us. Cross-Uber credibility is paramount.
-   **Radical Candor:** Assume best intent. I will give direct feedback for Uber's and your best interests, and I expect the same from you. I have thick skin; don't hold back.
-   **Write Things Down:**
    -   Ideas in "pencil" to clarify thinking.
    -   Decisions, timestamps, and assumptions in "pen" to ensure commitment.
    -   Revisit decisions when assumptions are invalidated.

## Section 2: This is Water (An Essay on Organizational Awareness)
This essay uses David Foster Wallace's 2005 speech as an "operating system for awareness" to diagnose and overcome Uber's organizational myopia.

### Identify "The Water": Our Most Obvious, Hard-to-See Reality
-   "The Water" is the set of constant, ubiquitous realities that become invisible, like processes, metrics, and assumptions.
-   At Uber, our "water" is the critical, persistent growth gap versus our competitor , defined by lower new-user retention , failure to build habits , and slower service.
-   We must see this "banal" fact as the "life-or-death" issue it is.

### Recognize the "Organizational Default Setting"
-   The "default setting" is the natural, hard-wired tendency to be self-centered.
-   Organizationally, this manifests as an inward focus on our own complex internal realities (roadmaps, OKRs, technical debt) instead of the customer's simple, external need.

### Challenge Our "Objects of Worship"
-   Everyone worships something; the only choice is what. Worshipping false idols (metrics, optimization, technical elegance) will "eat you alive".
-   Our default setting is to worship "disconnected levers":
    -   We worship the metrics of timeliness (ATD) instead of the user's feeling of reliability.
    -   We worship the size of the discount instead of the strategy of habituation.
    -   We worship internal complexity and siloed systems instead of the holistic user experience.

### The Call to Action: Choose "Imaginative Empathy"
-   The real work is to consciously choose what to think and get free of our default setting.
-   This requires choosing to see the user as a human, not an abstract data point.
-   We must shift our focus from optimizing disconnected internal levers to solving the user's holistic "job to be done".
-   There are "No silver bullets" ; victory comes from the "Game of Inches" —the "unsexy" daily work of earning loyalty.

## Section 3: How to Build Big, Hard Things at Uber (A Product Manager's Toolkit)
This section is a "Change Management Manual" for product leadership, designed to navigate Uber's "coordination tax" and lead complex initiatives to success.

### The Product Premortem: Why Big Initiatives Fail
Most guidance focuses on "Wrong Product" (Failure Type 1) , but the most common failures are organizational (Types 2-4):
-   **Type 2: Wrong Strategy:** The product is right, but it doesn't help the company win.
-   **Type 3: Lack of Conviction/Investment:** The company fails to commit resources, leading to jostling and a doomed "MVP".
-   **Type 4: Unsustainable Operation:** The MVP succeeds, but the team fails to roll out or operate it effectively at scale.

### The "Why" of Change: Product Leadership IS Change Management
-   Any new initiative is a "Change" that forces people through a predictable "Transitions model" (Ending -> Neutral Zone -> New Beginning).
-   Change is scary. The leader's job is to help everyone cross the "chasm" of the Neutral Zone (confusion, frustration).
-   This requires key leadership skills: Listen with empathy , Communicate with honesty , Act decisively to manage ambiguity , and Reassess & adapt by owning mistakes.

### The "How" of Change: The 8-Step Adapted Kotter Model
This is a step-by-step plan for holistically managing organizational change:
1.  **UNDERSTAND:** Gather not just facts, but also feelings and perceptions to know "where we are now".
2.  **MOTIVATE:** Create a "burning platform for change" to align all stakeholders on the urgency of moving.
3.  **ENLIST:** Build a "guiding coalition" of influential sponsors and advocates from all key teams.
4.  **CREATE:** Develop the vision, strategy, and roadmap. This must "Start with Why" and empower the team, not just dictate the "what".
5.  **EVANGELIZE:** Communicate the vision compellingly and frequently ("Repetition doesn't ruin the prayer") so every individual can map their smallest task back to the vision.
6.  **ENABLE:** Remove friction and add thrust. This means securing resources , locking in cross-functional commitments , codifying the "objective function" (trade-offs) , and formalizing decision-making (e.g., RAPID).
7.  **DELIVER:** Generate short-term wins to build momentum and earn the credibility needed for the long-term vision.
8.  **SUSTAIN:** Build enduring organizational "muscles". This is about creating a team that can win without you through Empowerment (autonomy) , Skill (competency) , Will (motivation) , and Succession planning.

## Section 4: Uber = Problem Solved (A Strategy for Local Commerce)
This section details a multi-year vision for Uber Delivery to win in "Broad Local Commerce" by shifting from a merchant-first "mall" builder to a user-first "problem solver" powered by Generative AI.

### The Core Value Flywheel: Maximize "Problems Solved"
-   The goal is to solve as many user problems and impulses as possible, as fast as possible, in as many channels as possible.
-   The primary objective is to Maximize "Problems Solved". The leading indicator is "Weekly Eyeballs".

### Pillar 1: "Leapfrog" Discovery-Customization-Satisfaction Loop
-   **Leapfrog with Gen AI:** Instead of a multi-year effort to reach parity on search/browse , we must use Gen AI to "leapfrog" competitors by solving ambiguous user problems. This requires:
    -   Ambiguous (Voice) Search.
    -   Multi-item, multi-store "Transactable Solution Widgets".
    -   Multi-turn iterative improvement ("as easy as speaking your mind").
-   **Innovate on "Early Occasion Life Cycle" (EOLC):** Shift from ELC (user) to EOLC (occasion). We must teach users the many ways Uber can provide joy. This is done via a "Wall of Member Delights" offering "X% off the first N trips" for narrowly-defined occasions (e.g., "SMB coffee & pastry shop") to build habits.

### Pillar 2: Accelerated Inspiration Loop ("The Product IS the Marketing")
-   **The "Problem-Solving Card":** Create a new, "1-click transactable" landing page. This card is the compelling wrapper for a Gen AI-generated solution (like a multi-item list) and is essentially a reusable prompt resolved for each user's unique context (location, history).
-   **UGC & the "Affiliate Creator Gig":** Allow users, partners, and creators to generate their own Problem Cards. This creates a new "Affiliate Creator Gig" where influencers can earn a commission from transactions driven by their content (e.g., a TikTok video deep-linking to a card).
-   **Syndicate Everywhere via Deeplink:** Distribute these Problem Cards everywhere users are : physical QR codes , social video feeds , Google Search , and ChatBots/Agents to reduce disintermediation.

### Pillar 3: Core Local Commerce Marketplace Loop (Assortment & Fulfillment)
-   **The Problem:** Our current "courier-only" model limits our assortment and creates a "merchant cold start problem".
-   **Retail Solution: Tiered Fulfillment:** Massively expand unique assortment by innovating on fulfillment. This requires a 6-tier system:
    1.  Hyperlocal Courier (Current)
    2.  Uber Connect Pickup (BOPIS)
    3.  "Over-the-Top" Personal Shopper
    4.  National Overnight Carrier
    5.  Fulfilled by Merchant
    6.  Items + Value-Added Services (e.g., TV installation, furniture assembly)
-   **Food Solution: "Food Experiences":** Innovate by offering new combinations of Price, Speed, and Experience. This includes:
    -   Meal Deals (Low Price)
    -   Promoted Pickup (Low Price / High Effort)
    -   Next Level DineOut (High Experience)
    -   Meal Plans (e.g., HelloFresh)
